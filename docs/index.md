# Zero Play #
## Teach a computer to play any game. ##
The zero play library is based on the ideas in the [AlphaGo Zero paper] and the
example Python code in the [alpha-zero-general project]. The goal of this
project is to make a reusable Python library that other projects can build on
to make powerful computer opponents for many different board games.

So far, the only command is `zero_play`. It takes an option for the game.
The default game is Tic Tac Toe.

    $ zero_play
      ABC
    1 ...
    2 ...
    3 ...
    
      ABC
    1 ...
    2 .X.
    3 ...
    Player O:

You can choose Connect 4 with the `--game` option.

    $ zero_play --game zero_play.connect4.game.Connect4Game

I'm planning to keep a [journal] for the project.
