title: Connect 4 Rules

---
Players: 2

### Goal
Place your pieces to make a line of four in a row, either vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally.

![Example]

### Setup
Choose which player will play black and go first.

### Play
Starting with the black player, take turns adding your piece in one of the empty
spaces, but the piece will fall to the lowest empty space in the column. If you
make a line of four in a row, you win immediately. If the board is full without
any line of four in a row, the game is a draw.
